//! GPU-visible memory allocation and management.
//! 
//! When you create a buffer or a texture with Vulkan, you have to bind it to a chunk of allocated
//! memory. To do so, you have to pass a type that implements the `MemorySource` trait.
//! 
//! There are several implementations of the trait, ie. several things that you can pass to the
//! constructors of buffers and textures:
//! 
//! - `&Arc<Device>`, which will simply allocate a new chunk of memory every time (easy but not
//!   very efficient).
//! - `MemorySource`, which is the same as `&Arc<Device>` except that it will use the
//!   already-allocated block.
//! - ... needs more ...
//! 
//! # Synchronization
//! 
//! In Vulkan, it's the job of the programmer to enforce memory safety. In other words, the
//! programmer must take care that two chunks of memory are not read and written simultaneously.
//! 
//! In this library, this is enforced by the implementation of `MemorySource` or
//! `MemorySourceChunk`.
//! 
//! There are two mechanisms in Vulkan that can provide synchronization: fences and semaphores.
//! Fences provide synchronization between the CPU and the GPU, and semaphores provide
//! synchronization between multiple queues of the GPU. See the `sync` module for more info.
//!
//! # Sparse resources
//! 
//! **Not yet implemented**.
//! 
//! Instead of creating a buffer or an image with a single chunk of memory, you also have the
//! possibility to create resources with *sparse memory*.
//! 
//! For example you can bind the first half of the buffer to a memory chunk, and the second half of
//! the buffer to another memory chunk.
//! 
//! There is a hierarchy of three features related to sparse resources:
//! 
//!  - The `sparseBinding` feature allows you to use sparse resources.
//!  - The `sparseResidency` feature is a superset of `sparseBinding` and allows you to leave some
//!    parts of the resource unbinded before using it.
//!  - The `sparseResidencyAliased` feature is a superset of `sparseResidency` and allows you to
//!    bind the same memory chunk to multiple different resources at once.
//!
